            <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline ;">A Comment on "God"</p>
            <p>
                God cannot help you, because you are your own god. Scientifically. For the primary reason: <br><br>
                E=mc^2 <br><br>
                E= energy = soul = spirit = God= conciousness <br>
                m= mass = biology = animal form<br>
                c= speed of light in a vaccum = speed of how fast you talk to your "god"<br>
                
                "religion"= the framework you use to moderate your behaviour and train yourself with behaviour muscle memory <br>
                no religion is better than any other religion. The following categories of religion say the same thing: <br>
                Christianity, Hinduism, Bhuddism, Sikhism, Islam, Bahai, Taoism<br><br>
                <strong>Please note:</strong> additional religions may also comport to a good framework however i have only studied the ones listed.<br>
                The best religion for a personal peaceful life is Bhuddism. it is also nihilistic. Athiest. <br>
                The best religion to protect others while being peaceful is Sikhism. it is also nihilistic. Atheist.<br>
                Both religions are branches of Hindusim. Which has its own version of a nihilistic practice.<br>
                Hinduism and indigenous philosophies overlap on all forms.<br>
                Hindusim= the religion of many ppl living together in peace and harmony. <br>
                Indigenous= the religions of few ppl living far apart in isolated enviornmentes in peace and harmony. <br>
                Islam= the religion of people in love with peace and harmony. <br>
                Christianity= unknown. Christianity as it is practiced today was created inorganically almost 1000 years <br>
                after the death of Jesus Christ. Jesus was a learned person who appears as a prophet in Islam. He was the prophet of<br>
                the poor and weak. 
                <br>

                    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline ;">WARNING: Religion</p>
                    The following branches that try to claim to be a religion are a form of what is known as "taliban", a contortion of religion that is used for control <br>
                    Jehovas Witnesses- Christianity, Taliban-Islam, Evangelicals-Christianity, RSS- Hinduism, Khalistan- Sikhism<br>
                    <strong>Please note</strong>  ANY RELIGION that preaches that someone else is god, is not a true religion.<br>
                    In addition, religion in its authentic form, natrually leads to peace. which is the base human desire.<br>
                    a common desire we share with all life<br>
        
                    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline ;">Afterlife</p>
                    Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your understanding of science<br>
                    you were born alone, you die alone, you will not ever meet the ppl you are around here in the way you understand<br>
                    the "soul" rejoins the combined field of conciousness.<br>
                    those lucky few who do not come back, go elsewhere to an unknown place.<br>
                    the preservation or embalming of a human body is only for ceremonial reasons for those who are left behind<br>
                    once flesh is dead, it has lost the ability to sustain life. it can only be broken down.<br>
        
                    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline ;">Conciousness</p>
                    Your own conciousness is the energy that approaches the speed of light.<br>
                    This energy compells you to act in a way that is consistent to your personal choices.<br>
                    There is a mass imbalance because we have killed most living things on earth<br>
                    Since that energy is currently trapped and cannot be recycled back to earth due to climate change<br>
                    There is a deviation in the natrual harmonic frequency of the field of conciousness.<br>
                    It was casused by male supremecy. Which is antithetical to nature.<br>
                    All natrual societies are matriarical. In adherence with how mitochondrial DNA is passsed.<br>
                    As only the female form can give birth, the male form is biologically stronger to protect the power of the form that gives life <br>
                    The act of procreation is an energy intensive biological process.<br>
                    All children that are born from rape, will have that trauma encoded on their DNA, they will then perform rape.<br>
                    Therefore god is technically already with you. They have no gender identity in the field of concisouness. <br>
                    Gender identity is formed in-utero. It is a biological condition of partical physics.<br><br>

                Those individuals born two spirited, trans, are the only known links to the real field of conciousness.<br>
                The survival of all life depends on the preservation of all trans life. They are the kernel of the root of all life.<br>
                Multiple large organisms are trans. They are the anchors to life. they can only support life. they tend not to create or destroy life.<br>
                In addition it is against nature to violate the young. Even the girls. <br><br>

        <p>
            I invoke the principals of natrual law, without breaking a single law of the male world.<br>
            To preserve life in the style of my cultural framework, with adherense to all oaths i have taken,<br>
            I am hereby compelled to declare all forms of economic war on all forms of manhood.<br> 
            I vowed to do so when i took the iron ring oath<br>
            and when i took an oath to protect citizens during the course of my employment with the Government.<br>
            <br><br>
            I publically disavow the entire khalistan movement for a homeland. <br>

            Working Style
        </p>
        <p>
            I only work with men who are 25 or younger, due to efficency. Men over the age of 25 are virtually impossible to speak to. <br>
            If you are a man, unless a black woman or indegenous* person takes <br>
            responsibility for your actions, i do not work with you. I do not take money as a form of investment <br>
            in addition, ownership is a socialized male need. therefore i give up all forms of ownership.<br>
            i will only make as much money as needed to live.<br>
            If you are male and over the age of 25, you will have 3 min to explain why i should talk to you <br>
            as only 3% of all investment goes to women, if you cannot make your point in 3 min, you are not using time efficently.<br>
            should be a 30 second elevator pitch. if its longer I will get bored. My boredom is trained to be invoked when i the meeting is not adding value<br>
            I reserve the right to walk out abrumptly. DO NOT compliment me. That is a waste of my time. i know who i am. i dont care about ur opinion.

            I work as if there is an active war on women, children, earth, and all life. If you are of means and we do meet you will pay <br>
            i will accept payment as 2 shots of neat alchohol. moonshine is acceptable. the alchohol will be poured infront of me, from a newly opened bottle.<br>
            the alchohol makes it easier for me to slow down my brain so i can understand most people.

                The first rule of martial arts is not to engage in a fight by using your emotions. You make preventable mistakes. <br>
                Therefore you need to train your rage. In order to figure out what you can do, <br>
                you must first discover what your power is. And you must understand the weapons they used to enslave you <br>
                to help you along, i am making it free for you to access my 8 hr lab on how to code. <br>
                the most revolutionary thing that can tip the balance is if every girl child in the world <br>
                could code using a cell phone. so if you have access to a computer, sit down and learn to code <br>
                that is what they used to take away your rights. 8 hrs of education. <br><br>

            Just in case: Death
        </p>
        <p>
            It is against my religion as an athiest, my adopted culture of khalsa, physics and natrual law to commit suicide. <br>
            It is against natrual law to self destruct <br>
            Suicide traps the life energy pattern of personal conciousness to the world of partical physics <br>
            Forcing the individual to not merely return and be reborn, but encoding the nature of their death on DNA <br>
            In addition, karma, the encoding of trauma CASUED, ensures that one is reborn in the image of balance.<br>
            One is reborn as the thing they harmed most.<br>
            Therefore i cannot harm myself. If i die prematurely or suspiciously<br>
            I was assasinated. Please feel free to donate all my organs and return what is left to the earth in a shallow grave <br>
            it is my hope that one day tulips grow from my bones.
        </p>
